- Background color: Light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), offering a subtle backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFD700), used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and highlights, inspired by the golden hues of whisky.
- Clean and readable typography.
- Use icons that reflect the mountain theme (peaks, pine trees) alongside cocktail-related icons (glasses, shakers).
- Subtle parallax scrolling effects to give a sense of depth and immersion.
